# Recipe Generator Program 

## Program Description:  
Students will create a program that generates a shopping list for a recipe based on user input. The program will ask for the type of dish, the main ingredient, and the number of servings. It will then provide a recipe with ingredient quantities tailored to the dish.

- You will either need to make something up, or just go on allrecipes and find a good looking (probably simple) recipie

## Program Requirements:
- Ask Questions:
  - Ask the user for the type of dish (e.g., pasta, salad, soup).
  - Ask the user for the main ingredient (e.g., chicken, tofu, spinach).
  - Ask the user how many servings they want to make.
- Generate Recipe Instructions:
  - Use if/else statements to generate different recipes based on the dish type.
  - Calculate the ingredients needed based on the number of servings.
  - Provide specific instructions for each dish type.
- Display the Recipe:
  - Print out the recipe with ingredient quantities.
 
## Extensions:
- Add directions to each recipe
- Add more dish types and ingredients.
- Allow users to input additional ingredients and instructions.
- Provide error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values for servings).
